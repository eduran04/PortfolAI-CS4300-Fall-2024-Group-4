[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable false positives for Django ORM (objects manager is added dynamically)
# Ignore unused import and argument warnings (as requested by user)
# Ignore migration file naming (expected for Django - auto-generated)
# Allow some complexity for now (can be refactored later if needed)
# Allow duplicate code for now (can be refactored later if needed)
# Allow broad exception catching (necessary for API error handling - various API exceptions)
# Allow import outside toplevel (sometimes necessary for tests to avoid circular imports)
