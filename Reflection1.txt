This sprint went smoothly as our team colloaborated well and kept communication clear.
We divided responsibilities evenly and resolved issues quickly. Our main achievements included
setting up the repo, generate SSH keys, and build a simple landing page with very basic styling 
for the project. We have expanded our knowledge of Django, HTML5, and CSS, which help us to
hands-on experience in building the web applications while learning how to integrate front-end and 
back-end components effectively. Moving forward, our focus will be on refining the landing page to align 
with our wireframes, applying modern web design principles, and improving the overall user experience.
This sprint provided valuable lessons in teamwork, problem-solving, and collaborative development.

- Overall, our team collaborated effeciently and effectively while 
maintaining clear communication throughout the sprint. We divided tasks
well, and any issues that came up were resolved quickly. During this sprint,
we created a basic landing page with simple styling, set up a repository, and 
generated SSH keys within our environments. Additionally, we gained more experience
with django, HTML5, and related technologies. We also began looking at CSS styling 
resources online as we plan the next phase of development. In the future, our goal 
is to update and enhance the visual design of landing page so that it aligns to our
wireframe sketches and best practices.

- Overall, the team worked very well together and we were able to
efficiently figure out a plan of action to get this done as soon as
possible. We all divided the tasks pretty easily and were able to work
together to figure out all the issues and resolve them. One of the things
that we were working with for a long time to try and figure out was how
to display an image on the landing page and how to host the image because
there aren't a lot of websites that will offer a free image and it isn't
very efficient to host it locally from one person's device. In the next
iteration, I think it would be nice to make the landing page more aesthetic
and see if there's any way to further optimize the code as we go along.
