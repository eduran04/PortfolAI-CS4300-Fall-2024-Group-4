- Overall, the team worked very well together and we were able to
efficiently figure out a plan of action to get this done as soon as
possible. We all divided the tasks pretty easily and were able to work
together to figure out all the issues and resolve them. One of the things
that we were working with for a long time to try and figure out was how
to display an image on the landing page and how to host the image because
there aren't a lot of websites that will offer a free image and it isn't
very efficient to host it locally from one person's device. In the next
iteration, I think it would be nice to make the landing page more aesthetic
and see if there's any way to further optimize the code as we go along.
