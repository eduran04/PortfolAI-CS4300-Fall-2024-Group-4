- Overall, I believe our team worked well and communicated efficiently
throughout the course of our sprint. Tasks were divided well and issues 
were resolved with ease. We were able to create a basic landing page with
basic styling with ease. We were also able to clone the repository and 
create ssh keys in the environment. We also gained additional familiarity 
with django, HTML5, and more. We were also exploring css styling resources
online and are still deciding how to proceed from here. In future sprints
we want to focus on making the landing page more aesthetic to meet our 
wireframe sketches and adhere to best practices.

- Overall, the team worked very well together and we were able to
efficiently figure out a plan of action to get this done as soon as
possible. We all divided the tasks pretty easily and were able to work
together to figure out all the issues and resolve them. One of the things
that we were working with for a long time to try and figure out was how
to display an image on the landing page and how to host the image because
there aren't a lot of websites that will offer a free image and it isn't
very efficient to host it locally from one person's device. In the next
iteration, I think it would be nice to make the landing page more aesthetic
and see if there's any way to further optimize the code as we go along.
